This project will create a website that assists users in generating and keeping track of work outs. In order to access work out options you must log into your account. Users will be able to chose from predifined workout playlists, or create their own. Users will also be able to view a history of work outs they have performed, and record and keep track of their performance over time.  We can also a leaderboard so users can see how many workout points they have compared to other users.  User credentials will be stores in a salted has table in our database.
